This package provides tools for viewing Altair charts without a web connection in arbitrary Python
environments. Charts can be displayed either inline in a Jupyter notebook environment, or in a
separate browser window for use in any environment.

## Installation
Altair Viewer can be installed from the
[Python Package Index](http://pypi.org/project/altair_viewer) with ``pip``:
```
$ pip install altair_viewer
```

## Usage: General Environments
Altair viewer provides two top-level functions for displaying charts: ``altair_viewer.display()``
and ``altair_viewer.show()``. Their use is slightly different:

- ``altair_viewer.display(chart)`` is meant for use in interactive computing environments where
  a single Python process is used interactively. It will serve a chart viewer at a localhost
  URL, and any susequent chart created within the session will appear in the same window.
  The background server will be terminated when the main Python process terminates, so this
  is not suitable for standalone scripts.

- ``altair_viewer.show(chart)`` is meant for use once at the end of a script. It does the same
   as ``display()``, but automatically opens a browser window, and adds an input
  prompt to prevent the script (and the server it creates) from terminating.

## Usage: IPython & Jupyter
Within Jupyter notebook, IPython notebook, and related environments that support
[Mimetype-based display](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/file_formats.html),
altair viewer can be used by enabling the ``altair_viewer`` renderer:
```python
import altair as alt
alt.renderers.enable('altair_viewer')
```
This will cause charts at the end of a Jupyter notebook cell to be rendered in a
separate browser window, as with the ``display()`` and ``show()`` methods.

If enabled with ``inline=True``, charts will be rendered inline in the notebook:
```python
import altair as alt
alt.renderers.enable('altair_viewer', inline=True)
```
To display a single chart using Altair viewer in an IPython environment without globally
enabling the associated renderer, you can use the ``display`` method:
```python
import altair_viewer
altair_viewer.display(chart, inline=True)
```

Note that the display based on altair viewer will only function correctly as long as the
Kernel that created the charts is active, as it depends on the background server started
by the kernel. In particular, this means that if you save a notebook and reopen it later,
charts will not display until the associated cells are re-run.
